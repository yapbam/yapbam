fix
	When editing of subtransaction, clicking the check box "receipt" when the "amount" was empty caused an error.

version	0.9.8 (12/18/2011)
improvement

	The icons and warning messages (when the threshold of balance is exceeded or when there are periodic transactions to generate) were sometimes displayed on the wrong tab.
	When selecting a shortcut (symbolic link) in a file selection dialog, Yapbam did not follow the link to read/save the target file, but directly read/saved the shortcut file.

improvement
	It is now possible to display relative balances in the transactions tab (you have to click a balance to make it the reference for other balances).

	Closing Yapbam under Java 1.7:  didn't exit the java virtual machine process.

version	0.9.3 (09/25/2011)
fix
	In countries where the thousands separator is the point (Belgium, for example), when entering an amount without a currency unit (eg 5,25), this number was transformed into a different number (eg 525,00&nbsp;&euro;).
	In "Statements" tab: When opening multiple accounts while running Yapbam, editing transactions resulted in the appearance of the edit dialog of the transaction several times.

version	0.9.2 (09/18/2011)
fix
	Since the 0.9.0 version, when Yapbam was configured to remember the filter and the opened file between two launches, and Yapbam is closed with a password protected file opened, Yapbam was unable to start again. The only way to restart Yabam was to erase the line starting with "filter" in Data/.yapbam file.<br/> In order to fix this major problem as fast as possible, and as it is caused by a misconception of the filter backup, the filter backup is deactivated in this release when using password protected file.
	In importation: When the imported file contained invalid lines and the last column of the file wasn't attached to a transaction attribute, the importation failed.

version	0.9.1 (09/16/2011)
fix
	Exportation was impossible if a previous exportation has been made in a previous Yapbam version.

	When, in the transaction input dialog, you chose a predefined label with the date field empty, the error dialog signaled a program error.
	The mode creation dialog allowed the user to check the "use a checkbook" box then to uncheck the "Usable for expenses" box. Validating such a dialog caused an error.
	In the subtransaction edition dialog: When you chose a description in the popup menu by clicking on it with the mouse, the description appeared in the field (this is the normal behavior). But, when validating the input, the description saved was the one before selecting the predefined description !
	Entering an invalid regular expression in the "custom filter" dialog caused an error when validating the dialog.
